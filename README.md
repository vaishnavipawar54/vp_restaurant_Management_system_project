# vp_restaurant_Management_system_project
#### A complete Python code for a restaurant management system that uses Tkinter for the GUI, along with various calculations for pricing and services.

This system includes the following key features:

# UI Layout:

*A header with a title and local time.
*A calculator section to perform basic arithmetic.
*A form for order inputs like fries, burgers, drinks, etc.
*A price calculation button to compute total costs, service charges, and taxes.
*A price list pop-up window to display item prices.

# Functions:

*btnclick(): Appends clicked number or operator to the display.
*clrdisplay(): Clears the display.
*eqals(): Evaluates the current expression in the display.
*Ref(): Computes the total cost, service charge, tax, and overall cost based on the quantities entered for various items.
*reset(): Resets all entries and variables to their initial states.
*price(): Displays the price list in a new window.

The code uses ****Tkinter's****  **** Frame **** and **Label** widgets, and StringVar() for managing dynamic values, such as the calculated costs.
